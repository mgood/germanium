eMusic Gnome is a download manager for eMusic.com

eMusic Gnome will open .emp files and download the songs from eMusic.  The .emp
files can be opened from the toolbar button, or passed as command-line
parameters.

Requirements
============

Python 2.4 (2.3 may work, but I have not tested it)

python-gtk2
python-gnome2
python-gnomevfs (probably part of python-gnome2)
twisted
twisted.web


Installation
============

Run:
  sudo make install

The default is to install to /usr/local.  You may want to open "Makefile"
and change "prefix=/usr/local" to "prefix=/usr" or the menu icon may not
appear.
